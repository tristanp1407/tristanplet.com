        <strong>Where coding meets creativity,</strong> I excel in both
        front-end and back-end development. Whether it's sleek websites for
        small businesses or intricate, tailor-made web applications, my designs
        are all about speed, maintainability, and cutting-edge aesthetics. I
        bring web pages to life, ensuring theyâ€™re not just visually appealing,
        but loaded with a seamless, interactive user experience. My knack for
        weaving analytics into web projects means I deliver not just websites,
        but valuable insights that drive user engagement.
